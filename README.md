# WarCardGame_OOP_Python
A simple implementation of the 'War' card game in Python, created to practice OOP skills.

## Features
* **Card Dealing & Shuffling:** The deck is automatically created, shuffled, and dealt to two players at the start.
* **Head-to-Head Battles:** Simulates the core gameplay loop of players comparing their top cards, with the winner taking both.
* **'War' Scenario Handling:** Correctly manages the 'war' state when players' cards are tied, including placing cards face-down and determining the winner of the war.
* **Full Game Simulation:** The game runs automatically from the first hand to the conclusion without user input.
* **Win Condition:** The game correctly identifies the winner when one player collects all 52 cards.
